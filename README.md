# AI-Knowledge-Assistant-Generative-AI-Project-
Developed an AI Knowledge Assistant using LLMs and semantic search to deliver contextual, human-like responses for complex queries.


Built an AI-powered conversational assistant capable of retrieving information, answering complex queries, and generating contextual responses using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system integrates natural language understanding, vector-based semantic search, and prompt-engineering techniques to deliver accurate and human-like responses.

Key Features

Implemented LLM-based reasoning for natural, context-aware query handling.

Integrated a vector database for semantic retrieval of knowledge documents.

Designed prompt templates for summarization, Q&A, and task-specific generation.

Developed a REST API layer enabling external apps to interact with the assistant.

Built a lightweight UI to demonstrate real-time conversational interactions.

Added safety filters and response validation to ensure reliable outputs.
